<p>This is a text to help you reflect about your prefered positions at the time of working with people.</p>
<p>It is composed of questions regaring your practice that add up to shape a profile. You can review previous tests and see your scores to have a more nuanced sense.</p>
<p>The idea is for it to be flexible, and for it to be representative of yourself. I hope it can help you as a fluent mirror that keeps track of your process.</p>
<p>As a reference you can use the bellow numbers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bellow 40% is desagreement</li>
  <li>Between 40% and 60% its neutral</li>
  <li>Between 60% and 80% its a clear preference</li>
  <li>Between 80% and 100% its your prefered view</li>
</ul>
